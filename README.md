First LUA project, just a quick and simple addon to show your achievement score compared against your guild members.

Guild members must also have the addon installed for accurate results at all times. 

Addon works by appending achievement score to public note on launch and when an achievement is earned. 

It then reads these when displaying the leaderboard.

Commands are currently 

```
/gach
```
and 
```
/leaderboard
```
